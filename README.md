# Welcome to NC News

... a simple API built as part of the backend component of a software engineering bootcamp.

## What is the API for?

The API was primarily a way for me to learn and practice backend JavaScript, using tools including PostgreSQL, Knex and Express. In the near future it will meet its other half, a webapp that will form a useful and engaging frontend.

## What does the API do?

The API serves news articles and comments to the user, along with metadata relating to those items. It also enables users to post and delete comments on the articles. The new database is a prefab provided by my bootcamp.

## How do I interact with the API?

Requests to the API can be made as endpoints on the URL [https://nc-news-database.herokuapp.com/]
